This is the second part of the deep learning series and is focused on techniques that help improve the performance of the Neural network.

In this part, I implemented different kinds of initialization algorithms (including Xavier initialization),
different kinds of optimization methods (such as momentum and RMSprop), gradient checking and regularization.
