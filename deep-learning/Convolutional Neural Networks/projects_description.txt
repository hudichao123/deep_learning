In this folder, there are three projects on convolutional neural network. 


The first one Convolution model - Step by Step 
is about building up a convolutional neural network from scratch using numpy.
Both forward propagation and backward propagation are implemented in this module.


The second one Convolution model - Application 
is about building up, training a conv net using tensorflow and using the trained model
for image classification.


The third one Residual Networks
is about building up even deeper convnets composed of multiple residual blocks. This is done 
under the high level python framework --Keras.
